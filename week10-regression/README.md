# Week Ten: Regression

This week, we'll look at how to *predict* a continuous outcome using a continuous predictor! You can now say you're doing machine learning :)

## Notes

If you've downloaded the class repo to your local computer, be sure to go into your folder and run 'git pull' to download any new files.

## Upcoming Dates  

**November 20th**  
*Third Project Deliverable Due*

**November 27th**  
*No Class*


## Lecture

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week10-regression/Week_Ten_Regression.ipynb) for this week's lecture.

## Homework

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week10-regression/Homework_Ten.ipynb) for this week's homework. Homework is due November 20th at 6:30 PM sharp. Anything submitted after that will receive a 0.

## Classwork

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week10-regression/Regression_Workbook.ipynb) for this week's classwork.

## Utils Package

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week10-regression/Using_Utils_Package.ipynb) for a brief look at how to use the functions from the utils package.

## Extra Credit Assignment

For this week's extra credit assignment, please run a regression model on two continuous distributions from your dataset. Even if the relationship may seem nonsensical, I want you to get comfortable running and applying a regression model on real-world data.

Be sure to transform the data if it is required, though for now please only transform the response variable.

If there are no continous distributions in your data whatsoever (or at least two continuous distributions), use the data from [Week 2](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week02-descriptive_statistics/Descriptive_Statistics_Class_Workbook.ipynb).

Get in touch with me if you are having issues applying this to your data! Even if it isn't a perfect fit, I want you to be comfortable applying the concepts we learn in class to your own data.

This submission can get you up to **5 extra points** on your midterm.

It is due **November 20th at 6:30 PM** sharp - nothing submitted after that will be accepted. Please submit it to my email with the subject 'Extra Credit Assignment \#3'

## Readings

#### [Linear Regression](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading25.pdf)

Some basics on linear regression.

#### [Linear Regression Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtKeHnfK5uA)  
This video, if you can handle the French accent of the narrator :), is another good resource for understanding the basics of linear regression.

#### [Interpreting Log Transformations in a Linear Model](https://data.library.virginia.edu/interpreting-log-transformations-in-a-linear-model/)

This page has a helpful for interpreting how to interpret a linear regression model when either the predictor or response variable, or both, are log transformed.
