See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week07-hypothesis_testing/Hypothesis_Testing_Class_Workbook.ipynb) for this week's classwork.

## Pandas Merging

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week07-hypothesis_testing/Merging_Datasets_Pandas.ipynb) for a quick notebook on how to merge dataframes in Pandas - potentially useful for your project.

## Bots, Bots, Bots!

I had 10,000 bots take the midterm via making random guesses. Check out the results [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week07-hypothesis_testing/Midterm_Bot.ipynb).
