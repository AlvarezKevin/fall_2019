This submission can get you up to 5 extra points on your midterm. It is due November 6th at 6:30 PM sharp - nothing submitted after that will be accepted. Please submit it to my email with the subject 'Extra Credit Assignment \#1'

## Readings

#### [Introduction to Hypothesis Testing](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading17b.pdf)

Good notes that cover the terminology we go over today (and last week) in class.

#### [More Hypothesis Testing](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading18.pdf)

More notes that cover running a hypothesis test as well as the methodology behind t-tests.

#### [Even More Hypothesis Testing](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading19.pdf)

A good review that covers z-tests, one and two-sample t-tests, and chi-square tests.

#### [Bootstrap Confidence Intervals](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading24.pdf)

Reading on bootstrap confidence intervals.

#### [Running Chi-Square Tests With Die Roll Data in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/running-chi-square-tests-in-python-with-die-roll-data-b9903817c51b)

Good blog post about using Chi-Square methods to evaluate whether a die is fair or not, similar to what we did in class.

#### [Mistakes, We've Drawn a Few](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368) *(Optional)*
Highly recommended blog post from the Economist reflecting on errors that they've made in previous data visualizations.

#### [How I Eat For Free in NYC Using Python, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, and Instagram](https://medium.com/@chrisbuetti/how-i-eat-for-free-in-nyc-using-python-automation-artificial-intelligence-and-instagram-a5ed8a1e2a10) *(Optional)*

I can't officially endorse this kind of wholescale scamming but some of you may find this a good application of Python :)

#### [How Randomness Can Arise From Determinism](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-randomness-can-arise-from-determinism-20191014/) *(Optional)*

Playing with a simple bean machine illustrates how deterministic laws can produce probabilistic, random-seeming behavior.
