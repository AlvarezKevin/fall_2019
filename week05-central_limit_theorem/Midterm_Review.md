### Descriptive Statistics
What types of data are there? What is the difference between discrete and continuous data?  
What are some useful statistics to describe discrete data? What is useful for decribing continuous data?
What are some common measures of central tendency? When are each of them useful? When are each of them less useful?  
What are some common measures of spread? How are they found? Which measures of spread are more common? Which measures of spread are more susceptible to outliers?  
What's a skewed distribution? What's the difference between a positively and negatively skewed distribution?  
What is the mode in the context of a continuous distribution? Why is it useful?

### Discrete Distributions
What defines a discrete distribution?  
What is the probability mass function? What does it mean?  
What is the cumulative distribution function? What does it mean?  
What is a Bernoulli distribution?  
What is a Binomial distribution?  
What is a Geometric distribution?  
What is a Poisson distribution?  
What are the assumptions of these distributions?  
Which parameters do each of these distributions require?  
Can you identify which distribution is used when?  
Can you give me an example of each of these distributions?   What is the probability mass function?  
What is the cumulative distribution function?  
What is expected value? Why can it be counterintuitive? Does the expected value have to be equal to an outcome in a discrete distribution?

### Continuous Distributions
What is the difference between a discrete distribution and a continuous distribution?  
What is the fundamental difference between the probability mass function and the probability distribution function, and thus a central tenet of the difference between discrete and continuous variables, and the method in which we measure them?  
What is the exponential distribution? What other distribution does it relate to? What are the assumptions behind these two distributions?  
What is the cumulative distribution function in the context of a continuous distribution?  
What are the parameters for the normal distribution? What is the standard normal distribution?  
What is a Z-score? Why is it important? What does a negative Z-score mean? What does a positive Z-score mean?  

### Central Limit Theorem
What is the law of large numbers?  
What is the Central Limit Theorem? Why is the Central Limit Theorem so important?
