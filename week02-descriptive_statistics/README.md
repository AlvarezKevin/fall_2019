# Week Two: Descriptive Statistics

This week, we will cover some methods for understanding and describing a single variable distribution, including understanding measures of central tendency and spread, along with appropriate visualizations to display the distribution. We'll do a LOT of Pandas.

## Readings

#### [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)  
Chapter 2 (review this week), Chapter 3 (next week)

#### [Most Canadians Are Now Better Off Than Most Americans](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-29/america-s-middle-class-is-losing-ground-to-canada-s)
Here's the article we reviewed in class.

#### [Unlearning Descriptive Statistics](http://debrouwere.org/2017/02/01/unlearning-descriptive-statistics)
An extremely straightforward blogpost about what's important in descriptive statistics and how to find it.

#### [Exploratory Data Analysis - Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rasbt/data-science-tutorial/blob/master/code/eda.ipynb)  
Sebastian Raschka is a scientist who's created a lot of good instructional materials for Python and machine learning (I own and recommend his *Python Machine Learning* book for those who want to go deeper down the rabbit hole after this course.). I'll be referencing his notebooks when necessary - nothing groundbreaking here, but a good reinforcement of what we covered in class (also some stuff that we'll cover later in the course such as correlation)

#### [Summary Statistics - Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rasbt/data-science-tutorial/blob/master/code/summary-stats.ipynb)  
Another Sebastian Raschka notebook on summary statistics.

#### [Matplotlib Tutorial](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html)
Good reference for the basics of Matplotlib.

#### [Git - The Simple Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) *(Optional)*    
A simple guide for getting started with Git! Good as a backpocket reference.

#### [Python Plotting With Matplotlib (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide) *(Optional)*
A more in depth guide to Matplotlib. I don't want to overwhelm you with Matplotlib info because it can be overwhelming, but some may find this useful for now and later.

#### [Top 50 Matplotlib Visualizations](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/top-50-matplotlib-visualizations-the-master-plots-python) *(Optional)*
See examples of some cool data visualizations!

#### [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com) *(Optional)*
Even more cool data visualizations!
