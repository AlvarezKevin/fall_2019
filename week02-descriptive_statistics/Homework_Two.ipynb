    "Homework is graded on 'effort', meaning that you will get full credit if you attempt a question but get an incorrect answer. That said, there are two caveats: 1) if you can't find the answer for the question, write a note in a Markdown cell explaining what you can't find and 2) your notebook must be able to run - meaning that it will run from top to bottom with none of the cells breaking. Before sending to me, go to Kernel up on the dropdown menu and run Restart and Run All to confirm that the code can run successfully."
