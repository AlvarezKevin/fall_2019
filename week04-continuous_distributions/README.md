# Week Four: Discrete Distributions

This week, we will continue our introduction to probability by looking at continuous distributions.

## Notes

If you've downloaded the class repo to your local computer, be sure to go into your folder and run 'git pull' to download any new files.

## Upcoming Dates  

**October 2**  
*Midterm*

## Administrative

~Jie Lan lanjie3458@gmail.comâ€‹ will be the peer tutor for this class. The first day of tutoring begins the week of **September 9th**. I will pass along any more information as I receive it. (\**update: Jie may no longer be our tutor. Again, I will pass along any more information as I receive it.)~

Until I get further notice from the school administration, I am assuming that Jie Lan will no longer be the tutor for this class. I will update you if I hear anything further.
