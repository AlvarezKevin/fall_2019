## Readings

#### [Linear Regression](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading25.pdf)

Some basics on linear regression.

#### [Linear Regression Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtKeHnfK5uA)  
This video, if you can handle the French accent of the narrator :), is another good resource for understanding the basics of linear regression.

#### [Interpreting Log Transformations in a Linear Model](https://data.library.virginia.edu/interpreting-log-transformations-in-a-linear-model/)

This page has a helpful for interpreting how to interpret a linear regression model when either the predictor or response variable, or both, are log transformed.
