# Week Nine: Relationships Between Variables

This week, we'll look at how to observe and measure the relationships between continuous variables.

## Notes

If you've downloaded the class repo to your local computer, be sure to go into your folder and run 'git pull' to download any new files.

## Upcoming Dates  

**November 20th**  
*Third Project Deliverable Due*


## Lecture

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week09-relationships_between_variables/Week_Nine_Relationships_Between_Variables.ipynb) for this week's lecture.

## Homework

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week09-relationships_between_variables/Homework_Nine.ipynb) for this week's homework. Homework is due November 13th at 6:30 PM sharp. Anything submitted after that will receive a 0.

## Classwork

See [here](https://github.com/CSC217/fall_2019/blob/master/week09-relationships_between_variables/Relationships_Between_Variables_Workbook.ipynb) for this week's classwork.

## Extra Credit Assignment

For this week's extra credit assignment, please apply either a z-test, one or two-sample t-test, bootstrap test, or chi-squared test to the data from your project as you see fit and submit it separately from your project update. If there isn't a natural fit for your data, do an unnatural test - make up a mean and do a t-test to see if your data is significantly different than that mean, or split your data into two at your own accord (say, western states and eastern states or developed countries and undeveloped countries) and see if there is a statistically significant difference in their means via boostrapping.

Get in touch with me if you are having issues applying this to your data! Even if it isn't a perfect fit, I want you to be comfortable applying the concepts we learn in class to your own data.

This submission can get you up to **5 extra points** on your midterm.

It is due **November 13th at 6:30 PM** sharp - nothing submitted after that will be accepted. Please submit it to my email with the subject 'Extra Credit Assignment \#2'

## Readings

#### [Covariance and Correlation](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/MIT18_05S14_Reading7b.pdf)

A good reading on covariance and correlation.

#### [Data Transformation](https://medium.com/@TheDataGyan/day-8-data-transformation-skewness-normalization-and-much-more-4c144d370e55)

Some information on transforming skewed data.

#### [Spurious Correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations?_ga=2.131319759.1727091509.1572718782-417206664.1572718782)

Correlation does not imply causation!

#### [This != That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxSUqr3ouYA&feature=youtu.be&_ga=2.131319759.1727091509.1572718782-417206664.1572718782)

Great video showing how correlation findings can be misinterpreted and exploited.
