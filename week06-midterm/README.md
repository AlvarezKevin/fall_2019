# Week Six: Midterm

Midterm time! You'll also get the details on the project you'll complete in the second half of the semester.

Note that there is no class for the next two weeks due to Yom Kippur next week and Monday classes on Wednesday the week after that. That said, your first project deliverable will still be due at **6:30 P.M. on October 16th** even though we don't have class that day. This will give me a chance to review your proposal and give you feedback before class the week after. Please email me at **eagovino@ccny.cuny.edu** with the deliverables required.



Enjoy the break and use the time to think of some fun ideas for your project!

## Notes

If you've downloaded the class repo to your local computer, be sure to go into your folder and run 'git pull' to download any new files.
