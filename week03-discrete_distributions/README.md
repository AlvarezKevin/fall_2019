More info on discrete distributions.

#### [Why We Love The CDF And Do Not Like Histograms That Much](http://debrouwere.org/2017/02/01/unlearning-descriptive-statistics)
Good overview of why the CDF is better for comparing multiple distributions than histograms. We will review this more in depth in a future class, but it's a good read on why the CDF is an important visual tool.

#### [What Does Randomness Look Like? (Spoiler: Poisson Distribution) (Optional)](https://www.wired.com/2012/12/what-does-randomness-look-like/)
